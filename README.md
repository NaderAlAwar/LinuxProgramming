# LinuxProgramming
This repository contains various projects I have implemented in Linux.
TTT_Multi_Process.c and TTT_Multi_Thread.c contain the code for	a multithreaded program that uses the Linux pthread library to simulate two “computer” players, each represented by a thread running the minimax algorithm, play a game of tic-tac-toe.
create_messagebox.c contains a bunch of system calls that implement a message passing interface between users. messagebox.h contains the header file for the messagebox that contains the messages, and test1.c is used for testing.
eece432_dev.c contains an implementation for a character device driver for Linux.
